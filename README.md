# Custom-Video-Player
A modern looking video player feat. HTML5 Video API

Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, Vanilla Js (no framework or SDK).

*** Implementation ***
* First of all, we added an SVG as a hero image because an svg can scale upto any size according as the size of the viewport.
* Then added a video element with `playsinline` attribute which gonna prevent the video to be played in full screen mode by default on mobile views.
